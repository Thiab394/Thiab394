###

<p align="left">Hi, my name is Thiago Oliveira Cunha, i'm from Brazil, i'm a enthusiast on technology, maths and basically everything that is in the field of exact sciences, I like to see things make sense on paper and in practice, and I am also fascinated by the origin of technologies, such as knowing how a computer really works or for a more tangible example, programming in assembly language. <br><br>- 🔭 i'm currently a Software Engineering student in the "Universidade de Brasilia(UnB)", in the last semesters of the course, throughout the course the technologies/areas that attracted me the most were assembly language and backend development, currently trying to be a better developer in general <br>- 📚 I'm currently learning more about Web Development, Python, embedded systems and seeking what else could catch my interest <br>- ⚡ In my free time i play videogames from all kind, watch some videos on YouTube, Listen to relaxing music, go to the gym and try to acquire skill in the technologies i'm learning in the moment </p>
